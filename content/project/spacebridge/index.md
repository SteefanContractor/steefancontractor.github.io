title: "UK/Aus Space Bridge"
summary: "A novel application of passive GPS signals (GNSS-R) picked up by cube satellites to detect the location and age of Antarctic sea ice. We conducted an intercomparison of explainable machine learning and deep learning ([tabnet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07442)) algorithms to understand which GNSS-R variables are used by the models with the highest ice detection skill. In collaboration with [Spire Global](https://spire.com/), thanks to the UK-Australia Spacebridge grant organised by [SmartSat CRC](https://smartsatcrc.com/)."
